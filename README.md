# Python-Live-Project
#### This is my Python Live Project at The Tech Academy. It was a two week sprint in an Azure DevOps style project. The objective was to complete as many boards as possible with the minimum being four to pass. We were at a disadvantage due to this happening the week of Thanksgiving holiday so there were two less days to complete this. I managed to complete 5 stories. 
#### The overview of the project was to create apps designed to take advantage of various Python and Django features. We would create databases to keep track of data, interact with APIs to retrieve data, use data scraping to collect and aggregate data, and more. This project is built using Python, Django, SQLite, and HTML/CSS. 
### Story One
#### The first story I was assigned was to create a new app for the project, named appropriately for what I was tracking, and get it to display a home page with basic content. My app was a recipe collection called MyRecipes. The first thing for me to do was to create a new app using manage.py startapp. Then I registered the app to the main project by editing the main apps settings.py. I then created a base and home HTML template but I used a special naming convention to keep mine from interfering with the main apps templates. I used “MyRecipes_”before my templates individual names. After that I created a [views.py](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/views.py) for my app with a function to display my home page. I had to create an urls.py(link to urls.py) to route my view function to the home page. On my home page(link to MyRecipes_home.html) I had to add a title, Navbar, and a footer with some basic CSS(link to style.css) to style the background of that page. One of the last things to do was to add an image link(link to code snippet) to the main app’s home page so you could navigate to my app. I did this using a stock picture of a table with some food plated and a glass of wine, which I downloaded from the internet.(link to cover_photo.jpg) I opted to use this same picture as a backdrop for my base.html(link to MyRecipes_base.html). This gave me the theme for each additional page that I would create.
