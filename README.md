# Python-Live-Project
#### This is my Python Live Project at The Tech Academy. It was a two week sprint in an Azure DevOps style project. The objective was to complete as many boards as possible with the minimum being four to pass. I completed five. 
#### The overview of the project was to create apps designed to take advantage of various Python and Django features. We would create databases to keep track of data, interact with APIs to retrieve data, use data scraping to collect and aggregate data, and more. This project is built using Python, Django, SQLite, and HTML/CSS. 
### Story One
#### The first story that I was assigned was to create a new app for the project, named appropriately for what I was tracking, and to get it to display a home page with basic content. My app was a recipe collection called MyRecipes. The first thing to do was to create a new app using manage.py startapp. I registered the app to the main project by editing the main apps settings.py. I created a base and home HTML template but I used a special naming convention to keep mine from interfering with the main apps templates. I used “MyRecipes_”before my templates individual names. After that I created a [views.py](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/views.py) for my app with a function to display my home page. I had to create an [urls.py](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/urls.py) to route my view function to the home page. On my home page, [MyRecipes_home.html](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/templates/MyRecipes/MyRecipes_home.html) I had to add a title, Navbar, and a footer with some basic CSS to style the background of that page. My CSS file name is [style.css](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/static/css/style.css). One of the last things to do was to add an image link to the main app’s home page so you could navigate to my app. I copied my part of that code and named it [code snippet](AppBuilder9000/snippet.html). I did this using a stock picture of a table with some plated food and a glass of wine, which I downloaded from the internet, [cover_photo.jpg](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/static/images/app-images/cover_photo.jpg). I opted to use this same picture as a backdrop for my base HTML page, [MyRecepies_base.html](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/templates/MyRecipes_base.html). This gave me the theme for each additional page that I would create.

### Story Two
#### For the second story, I was tasked with creating a model for the collection item that I would be tracking and add the ability to create a new item. First, I created a file named [models.py](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/models.py). On my models.py, I created a class called Recipe, an objects manager, and a string method. The criteria was that my model have at least four field types and one widget. I created six fields and one widget. I then created a model form, [forms.py](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/forms.py) with all the inputs and labels needed. After which I created a template named [Myrecipes_create.html](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/templates/MyRecipes/MyRecipes_create.html) that will be used to format a form for the user to input all the information for the recipe. I used Django Crispy Forms to make my form easy to render without spending a long time trying to format it myself. This form is configured to submit the information using the POST method and to send a CSRF token along for security. All this is initiated by the hyperlink in the Navbar called "Create Recipe". Clicking this link calls up a function on my views.py called ‘MyRecipes_create’. This function redirects you to the form and once it is submitted, it checks to see that everything is valid. After validation, it uses the save function to save this data to the database. I added a new URL to my urls.py and updated the CSS file as I went along adding each new page.

### Story Three
#### For the third story, I was to display all the information in my database to a web page. First, I created a new template called [MyRecipes_recipes.html](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/templates/MyRecipes/MyRecipes_recipes.html). I would use this page to display a list of recipes that are hyperlinks. To do this I updated my views.py by creating a function that would get all the titles of the objects and their Primary IDs. It would pass this to a dictionary named ‘content’ and render it to the template MyRecipes_recipes.html. I also added that URL to my urls.py and added to my CSS file.

### Story Four
#### Story four is where I am to create a web page that will display any recipe that is selected. I updated my views.py again by creating a function called  MyRecipes_details. This function takes the object.id or pk(Primary key) and queries the database to get all the data associated with that instance of that object. It then passes this data into the variable ‘content’ and renders the [MyRecipes_details.html](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/templates/MyRecipes/MyRecipes_details.html) where it is displayed. I also added that URL to my urls.py and added to my CSS file.

### Story Five
#### For story five the spesifications were to allow the user to be able to edit and delete recipes. All of this will be done from the details page that I created earlier. Also, this will need to have a confirmation page before deleting. To do this I added two hyperlinks to my details page, update and delete. Each one points to its own function that I created on my views.py. For the update function, the user will be redirected to a new page that I created and named it [MyRecipes_update.html](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/templates/MyRecipes/MyRecipes_update.html). This page will utilize Crispy Forms to format the specified recipe much in the same way I did with my create function, but instead of a blank form it uses the Django shortcut get_object to pull the appropriate data and fill in the form. After the user updates whatever data they desire and they click the save button, this form is configured to submit the data using the POST method, and it includes the CSRF token for security. The update function then validates the data and saves it to the database. If the form or the CSRF token is invalid the user will stay on the update page and be shown whichever error message is applicable so they can correct it. There is also a back button on the update page if the user decides not to make any changes and just wants to go back to the recipe list.
For the delete function, the user will be redirected to another new page I created called [MyRecipes_delete.html](AppBuilder9000/MyRecipes/templates/MyRecipes/MyRecipes_delete.html). This page will display text that confirms that the user does want to delete this recipe along with a ‘Yes’ button and a ‘Home’ button, in case they change their mind. This is all done with the same POST method and CSRF token to guard against unauthorized changes. If everything is valid, the delete view function uses the delete function to delete this instance from the database. The user is then redirected back to the recipe list.

### My Take Away
#### I learned several hard lessons that will stick with me through out my new career. 
- The importance of adequate sleep! You can not function well without aduquate sleep.
- Proper planning is a must! You absolutley need a plan. It doesn't have to be all encompassing but you need to have a rough structure of what you need to acomplish. Then break it down into bite size pieces and focus on one element at a time.
- You must use proper version control! Always check and see what branch you are in everytime you sit down in front of your screen.
- It is OK to ask for help! I learned to ask for help when needed.
#### Despite all the challenges, this project concluded successfully. I completed the project through story 5. I believe these experiences have provided me with genuine insights applicable to my future career. I can collaborate effectively, navigate version control competently, and overcome challenges with a strategic approach.
### Thank you for checking out my project!
